# Bike Rental Demand Analysis & Prediction

## Objective
Analyse historical bike rental usage and build predictive models to understand key demand drivers and support data-driven operational planning.

---

## Dataset
- Bike rental usage data with temporal and environmental features  
- Additional metadata describing rental conditions  
- Data cleaning, preprocessing, and feature engineering applied prior to modelling  

---

## Methodology
- Exploratory Data Analysis and correlation assessment  
- Feature engineering and scaling  
- Regression modelling to predict rental demand  
- Model evaluation using prediction error and residual analysis
